## Analyst Track Abstract
#### Introduction
SkillCorner has revolutionized the industry by providing high-fidelity physical data that offers strong tactical context. However, for a scout under time pressure, the primary challenge lies in efficiently extracting actionable recruitment insights from these deep datasets. This project presents a Scouting Dashboard designed to maximize the value of SkillCorner’s unique aggregates while making complex data accessible to non-technical stakeholders. By streamlining the ability to filter players based on specific physical requirements and benchmarking them against positional averages, the tool translates raw tracking data into a clear recruitment strategy.
#### Usecase(s)
The dashboard enables users to execute pinpoint searches tailored to their team's philosophy. For example, a club seeking a dominant 1v1 winger can filter for high Explosivity Scores, a composite of top speed and acceleration frequency, to ensure a distinct physical advantage in duels. Furthermore, by isolating TIP (Team In Possession) Sprinting, scouts can quantify a player's proactive intent to exploit space behind the defensive line. Conversely, defensive profiles can be screened using OTIP (Opposition In Possession) HSR and High Deceleration Counts to identify "high-press" specialists who possess the reactive agility to disrupt opponent build-up. These applications ensure that physical data is always viewed through a tactical lens.
#### Potential Audience
The primary audience includes Heads of Recruitment and Data Scouts within clubs. The tool serves as a high-performance filtering layer, allowing recruitment teams to screen the Australian League (or any SkillCorner-covered league) based on rigorous physical standards. By ensuring that "eyes-on" scouting is prioritized for players already physically validated by the data, the tool optimizes departmental resources. A significant extension could be the integration of SkillCorner’s Dynamic Player Events, which would layer tactical intelligence over these physical profiles, creating a multi-dimensional screening tool that further enhances data-driven recruitment.
